# Motor-Control-for-EV-using-Simulink

## Introduction

Welcome to the Simulink Motor Control Project repository! This project focuses on implementing motor control using a Buck converter and PID controller in Simulink. Motor control plays a crucial role in electric vehicles.

In this project, we explore the integration of a Buck converter and a PID controller within the Simulink environment to achieve efficient and precise motor control. The Buck converter serves as a power electronics interface, regulating the voltage supplied to the motor, while the PID controller adjusts the motor's speed based on desired setpoints and feedback signals.

Feel free to explore the repository, experiment with the provided models, and contribute to further advancements in motor control technology!
